## Intro to RStudio Cloud: Penguins!!

- Using `palmerpenguins` data for warm-up exercises

- Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

- Access data through `palmerpenguins` package https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/


####If you are using your own RStudio environment:
- Make sure you have `tidyverse`, `here`, and `palmerpenguins` installed


```r
# Run package installation if you don't have these packages already
# As a reminder, installing takes package from internet to your computer 
# and only needs to be done once, not each session

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "palmerpenguins"))
```

---
## Intro to RStudio Cloud: Penguins!!

- Load `tidyverse`, `here`, and `palmerpenguins`

- Look at the penguins dataset using `glimpse`


```r
library(tidyverse) # for tidyverse
library(here) # for file paths
library(palmerpenguins) # for warm-up data
glimpse(penguins)
```

```

## Warm-up Exercises: WarmUpExercises.Rmd

- &lt;b&gt;Let's open RStudio cloud and do some warm-up examples&lt;/b&gt;
  - We will do one together and then give you 5-minutes to work through other examples and get familiar with RStudio Cloud

- Explore the penguins data
  - How many penguins of each species are there? &lt;i&gt;We will do this one together&lt;/i&gt;
  - How many penguins of each species and sex are there? Hint: use `count`
  - What is the mean length of flipper by species? Hint: use `group_by` and `summarize`
  - What is the mean flipper length by species and sex? 

- More advanced warm-up
  - Fit a simple linear regression between body mass and flipper length.
  - Test whether the average flipper length is significantly different between male and female penguins. Use t-test, lm, or glm

---
## Ex. 1: How many penguins of each species are there? 


```r
penguins %&gt;%
   count(species)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   species       n
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Adelie      152
## 2 Chinstrap    68
## 3 Gentoo      124
```

???
- Using `count` we see there are 3 different species and the number of penguins for each species
---
## Ex. 2: How many penguins of each species and sex are there?


```r
penguins %&gt;%
   count(species, sex)
```

```
## # A tibble: 8 x 3
##   species   sex        n
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Adelie    female    73
## 2 Adelie    male      73
## 3 Adelie    NA         6
## 4 Chinstrap female    34
## 5 Chinstrap male      34
## 6 Gentoo    female    58
## 7 Gentoo    male      61
## 8 Gentoo    NA         5
```
???
- `count` can take more than one variable to get a cross-tabs between the two variables

---
## Ex. 3: What is the mean length of flipper by species? 


```r
penguins %&gt;%
   group_by(species) %&gt;%
   summarize(
     MeanFlipperLength=mean(flipper_length_mm, 
                            na.rm=TRUE))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   species   MeanFlipperLength
##   &lt;fct&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Adelie                 190.
## 2 Chinstrap              196.
## 3 Gentoo                 217.
```
???
- `group_by` allows us to look at metrics by different subgroups like species
- when using `group_by` follow it with `summarize` to get metrics (like average) at the group level
- `na.rm=TRUE` removes missing data from the calculation
    - forgetting this argument will result in a value of `NA` as the function will try to average missing data

---
## Ex. 4: What is the mean flipper length by species and sex?


```r
penguins %&gt;%
   group_by(species, sex) %&gt;%
   summarize(
     MeanFlipperLength=mean(flipper_length_mm,
                            na.rm=TRUE))
```

```
## # A tibble: 8 x 3
## # Groups:   species [3]
##   species   sex    MeanFlipperLength
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Adelie    female              188.
## 2 Adelie    male                192.
## 3 Adelie    NA                  186.
## 4 Chinstrap female              192.
## 5 Chinstrap male                200.
## 6 Gentoo    female              213.
## 7 Gentoo    male                222.
## 8 Gentoo    NA                  216.
```
???
- As with `count`, you can `group_by` multiple variables

---
## Advanced Ex. 1: Linear regression (body mass &amp; flipper length)
.small[

```r
mod1 &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data=penguins)
summary(mod1)
```

```

## lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins)
## 
## Residuals:
##      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max

## F-statistic:  1071 on 1 and 340 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16
```
]
???
- use `lm` (linear model) function
- equation is written as y-variable ~ x-variables

---
## Advanced Ex. 2: Flipper length differences by sex: t-test


```r
t.test(flipper_length_mm ~ sex, data=penguins)
```

```
## 
## 	Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  flipper_length_mm by sex
## t = -4.8079, df = 325.28, p-value = 2.336e-06
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -10.064811  -4.219821
## sample estimates:
## mean in group female   mean in group male 
##             197.3636             204.5060
```
???
- ~ also used in `t.test` to separate what we want to measure (our y) and the groups of interest (our x)

## Overview of Survey Analysis using `srvyr` Package

1. Create a `tbl_svy` object using: `as_survey_design` or `as_survey_rep`

2. Subset data (if needed) using `filter` (subpopulations)

3. Specify domains of analysis using `group_by` 

4. Within `summarize`, specify variables to calculate including means, totals, proportions, quantiles and more


&lt;b&gt;Note: We will be teaching this in the reverse order!!!&lt;/b&gt;
---
## Set-up for Analysis
- `srvyr` package uses tidy-syntax but uses the `survey` package behind it to do calculations

- If using your own RStudio environment, install both packages:

```r
# Install survey and srvyr packages

remotes::install_github("bschneidr/survey", ref = "c217689")
install.packages("srvyr")
```

- First, we will set-up a design object and later talk about what it means

```r
library(survey) # for survey analysis
library(srvyr) # for tidy survey analysis

recs &lt;- read_rds(here("Data", "recs.rds"))

recs_des &lt;- recs %&gt;%
   as_survey_rep(weights=NWEIGHT,
                 repweights=starts_with("BRRWT"),
                 type="Fay",
                 rho=0.5,
                 mse=TRUE)
```
???
- need to install github version of survey package if you want CIs with quantiles
---
## Weighted Analysis for Continuous Variables

- Common functions for continuous summaries
   - survey_mean
   - survey_total (like sum)
   - survey_median
   - survey_quantile
   - survey_ratio

- Always call within `summarize`/`summarise`
---
## `survey_mean` Syntax


```r
survey_mean(
  x,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"),
  level = 0.95,
  proportion = FALSE,
  deff = FALSE,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```

To calculate a survey mean, we use this in `summarize`/`summarise`

```r
survey_design_object %&gt;%
   summarize(
      mean_varname=survey_mean(x = continuous_varname)
      )
```

???
Only required argument is the variable

---
## `survey_mean` Example 1: Mean dollars spent on energy

This is an example using the `recs_des` survey design object and `survey_mean` function defaults


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      TD_mean=survey_mean(x = TOTALDOL)
      )
```

```
##    TD_mean TD_mean_se
## 1 1859.397   15.59328
```
---
## `survey_mean` Example 2: Mean temperature setting for summer during the day

Run this code. What happens? Why?


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      TD_mean=survey_mean(x = SummerTempDay)
      )
```
---
## `survey_mean` Example 2: Mean temperature setting for summer during the day

Run this code. What happens? Why?


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      TD_mean=survey_mean(x = SummerTempDay)
      )
```

```
## Error: Problem with `summarise()` input `TD_mean`.
## x All replicates contained NAs
## i Input `TD_mean` is `survey_mean(x = SummerTempDay)`.
```

&lt;b&gt;How do we fix this code?&lt;/b&gt;

???
- missing data in temperature, need `na.rm=TRUE`
---
## `survey_mean` Example 2: Missing data solution


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      TD_mean = survey_mean(
        x = SummerTempDay, 
*       na.rm = TRUE )
      )
```

```
##    TD_mean TD_mean_se
## 1 72.42918 0.07933939
```

---
## `survey_median` Syntax


```r
survey_median(
  x,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  vartype = c("se", "ci"),
  level = 0.95,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```

???
Only required argument is the variable


---
## `survey_median` Example: Median temperature setting for summer during day

Fill in the blank:


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      TD_median=survey_median(x=_________,
                          na.rm=_________)
      )
```

--


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      TD_median=survey_median(x=SummerTempDay,
                              na.rm=TRUE)
      )
```

```
##   TD_median TD_median_se
## 1        72    0.2518573
```



---
## `survey_quantile` Syntax


```r
survey_quantile(
  x,
* quantiles,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"),
  level = 0.95,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```

???
- need both the variable and the quantiles in a vector e.g. (c(.25, .75))
---
## `survey_quantile` Example 1: 1st and 3rd quantile of dollars spent on energy


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      Spent=survey_quantile(
        x = TOTALDOL,
*       quantiles = c(.25, .75))
      )
```

```
##   Spent_q25 Spent_q75 Spent_q25_se Spent_q75_se
## 1  1153.142  2353.132     13.75375     22.64873
```
???
- This estimates the 25th and 75th percentile

---
## `survey_quantile` Example 2: 1st and 3rd quantile of dollars spent on energy now with confidence interval


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      Spent=survey_quantile(x = TOTALDOL,
                            quantiles = c(.25, .75),

```
---
## `survey_ratio` Syntax

- Note this estimates: `\(\sum x_i/\sum y_i\)` not `\(\sum \frac{x_i}{y_i}\)`


```r
survey_ratio(
* numerator,
* denominator,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"),
  level = 0.95,
  deff = FALSE,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```


---
## `survey_ratio` Example: mean dollars per BTU spent on energy


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   summarize(
      DolPerBTU=survey_ratio(
*        numerator = TOTALDOL,
*        denominator = TOTALBTU,
         na.rm = TRUE
         )
      )
```

```
##    DolPerBTU DolPerBTU_se
## 1 0.02411671 0.0002168955
```
---
## Practice on your own

- Open ContinuousExercises.Rmd and work through Part 1

- We will take 15 minutes. Use this time for the exercises and a break
---
## Weighted Analysis for Continuous Variables: Domain Analysis

- If we want to get estimates by another variable, we need to add a `group_by` statement before doing the analysis.

- Example: Average dollars spent on electricity by whether AC is used


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
* group_by(ACUsed) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    ElBill=survey_mean(DOLLAREL, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 3
##   ACUsed ElBill ElBill_se
##   &lt;lgl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 FALSE    972.      25.8
## 2 TRUE    1435.      15.8
```

## Domain Analysis: Totals

- If we want the overall electric bill too, use the `cascade` function instead of `summarize`


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   group_by(ACUsed) %&gt;%
   cascade(
      ElBill=survey_mean(DOLLAREL, 
                         na.rm=TRUE)
   )
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   ACUsed ElBill ElBill_se
##   &lt;lgl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 FALSE    972.      25.8
## 2 TRUE    1435.      15.8
## 3 NA      1375.      14.1
```

???
- Note the overall appears as NA

---
## Domain Analysis: Totals

- Also can add sample and pop sizes


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   group_by(ACUsed) %&gt;%
   cascade(
      ElBill=survey_mean(DOLLAREL, na.rm=TRUE),
*     N=survey_total(!is.na(DOLLAREL)),
*     n=unweighted(sum(!is.na(DOLLAREL)))
   )
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 6

##   &lt;lgl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1 FALSE    972.      25.8  15401242. 976901.       737
## 2 TRUE    1435.      15.8 102807008. 976901.      4949
## 3 NA      1375.      14.1 118208250.      0.0320  5686
```

???
- survey_total gets a weighted total
- unweighted does just that, an unweighted estimate, can also get an unweighted mean or any other stat

---
## Weighted Analysis for Specific Subpopulations

- filtering (subsetting) the data should be done AFTER specifying the design to ensure accurate standard errors

- Use the `filter` function after creating the survey design object and before summarizing

Wrong way:

```r
data %&gt;%
* filter(state=="NC") %&gt;%
  as_survey_design(...) %&gt;%
  summarize(AvgAge=mean(Age))
```

Right way:

```r
data %&gt;%
  as_survey_design(...) %&gt;%
* filter(state=="NC") %&gt;%
  summarize(AvgAge=mean(Age))
```

???
- The difference in these two methods occurs when the subpopulation doesn't occur in all strata or PSUs

---
## Subpopulation Example 1: Average electric cost of single family homes


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
  filter(HousingUnitType %in% c("Single-family detached",
                                "Single-family attached")) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    ElBill=survey_mean(DOLLAREL, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```

```
##     ElBill ElBill_se
## 1 1541.933  17.24834

## Comparisons with t-tests: `svyttest` Syntax

- t-tests are done in the package `survey` not `srvyr` but you can use the same design object


```r
svyttest(formula, # outcome~group for two-sample, outcome~0 for one-sample
         design,
         na.rm = FALSE
         ....)
```

???
- Uses standard R formula notation
- will go over examples of 1-sample, 2-sample, and paired t-test

---
## `svyttest` Example 1: One-sample t-test

- I keep my house at 68 degrees at night during the summer. Is this different from the national average?


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   svyttest(design=.,
            formula=I(SummerTempNight-68)~0,
            na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## 
## 	Design-based one-sample t-test
## 
## data:  I(SummerTempNight - 68) ~ 0
## t = 41.013, df = 94, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  3.424776 3.773247
## sample estimates:
##     mean 
## 3.599012
```

???
- Note the I notation, this does the arithmetic before modeling

---
## `svyttest` Example 2: Comparing two variables

- Do people keep their house the same temperature at night during the summer and the winter?


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   svyttest(design=.,
            formula=I(SummerTempNight-WinterTempNight)~0,
            na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## 
## 	Design-based one-sample t-test
## 
## data:  I(SummerTempNight - WinterTempNight) ~ 0
## t = 29.079, df = 94, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  2.995084 3.434072
## sample estimates:
##     mean 
## 3.214578
```

???
- this is a paired t-test
- testing whether the difference is 0 for each household
---
## `svyttest` Example 3: Two-sample t-test

- Are electric bills different between those with and without A/C?


```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   svyttest(design=.,
            formula=DOLLAREL~ACUsed,
            na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## 
## 	Design-based t-test
## 
## data:  DOLLAREL ~ ACUsed
## t = 14.772, df = 94, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in mean is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  401.4597 524.2894
## sample estimates:
## difference in mean 
##           462.8746
```



---
## Linear Regression or ANOVA: `svyglm` Syntax

- As with t-tests, regressions are done in the package `survey` not `srvyr` but you can use the same design object

- Syntax is similar between t-test and glm


```r
svyglm(formula, 
       design,
       na.action, #default is na.omit
       ....)
```
---
## `svyglm` Example: Two-sample

Same example as two-sample t-test: Are electric bills different between those with and without A/C?

&lt;b&gt;t-test:&lt;/b&gt;

```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   svyttest(design=.,
            formula=DOLLAREL~ACUsed,
*           na.rm=TRUE)
```

&lt;b&gt;glm:&lt;/b&gt;

```r
recs_des %&gt;%
   svyglm(design=.,
          formula=DOLLAREL~ACUsed,
*         na.action=na.omit)
```

???
- one major difference in how you specify to ignore NA values
- svyttest can only have 2-levels in group variable
- svyglm, the variable on right can be anything (continuous or factor)

- Region is a factor variable, if it is numeric - this will treat it like a linear model

## `svyglm` Example 2: Linear Model

- Is there a relationship between square footage and electric bill?
- Let's review the data first with a ggplot. &lt;i&gt;Note we use the original data and do &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; use the survey design object.&lt;/i&gt;

## Weighted Analysis for Categorical Variable

- Functions to use within `summarize` after `group_by`
   - survey_mean
   - survey_total

- Functions to get counts
  - survey_count

???

- we use the same mean and total functions as with continuous variables
- `survey_count` is new
    - has a similar structure as the standard (non-survey) version of count

---
## Set-up ANES Data for Examples


```r
anes &lt;- read_rds(here("Data", "anes.rds")) %&gt;%
   mutate(Weight=Weight/sum(Weight)*224059005) 
# adjust weight to sum to citizen pop, 18+ in Nov 2016 per ANES methodology documentation
anes_des &lt;- anes %&gt;%
   as_survey_design(weights = Weight,
                    strata = Stratum,
                    ids = VarUnit,
                    nest = TRUE)
```
???

- American National Election Studies
- provides weights that sum to the sample, but we want to get population estimates
    - need to adjust the weight to get it to the population count
- as we mentioned before we will cover setting up the sample design object later

---
## `survey_count` Syntax

- `survey_count` functions similarly to `count` in that it is &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; called within `summarize`

- Produces weighted counts and variance of your choice of those counts

```r
survey_count(
  x,
  ...,
  wt = NULL,
  sort = FALSE,
  name = "n",
  .drop = dplyr::group_by_drop_default(x),
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv")
)
```
???
- similar to count in that it takes one or many variables
- can change the variance type as we have seen in the other survey functions

---
## `survey_count` Example

- Cross-tab of population in each age group and gender

```r
anes_des %&gt;%
  survey_count(AgeGroup, Gender, name="n")
```

```
## # A tibble: 25 x 4
##    AgeGroup Gender         n     n_se
##    &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 18-29    Male   23706666. 1771369.
##  2 18-29    Female 20972922. 1373206.
##  3 18-29    Other    295319.  150903.
##  4 30-39    Male   17039603. 1129924.
##  5 30-39    Female 19385497. 1249208.
##  6 30-39    Other     48425.   34492.
##  7 30-39    NA       259882.  148534.
##  8 40-49    Male   15369292. 1204485.
##  9 40-49    Female 18047731. 1205972.
## 10 40-49    Other     25736.   25736.
## # ... with 15 more rows
```
???
- `survey_count` is placed on its own like `count`
- it does NOT go in a `summarize` function
- can take multiple variables
- can change the output count name, `n` is the default

---
## `survey_mean` and `survey_total` Examples

- `survey_mean` used with no x (variable) calculates a proportion of groups specified in `group_by`
- `survey_total` used with no x (variable) calculates a population count estimate for the groups specified in `group_by`

Cross-tab of population who voted in 2016

```r
anes_des %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(VotedPres2016)) %&gt;%
  group_by(VotedPres2016) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    p=survey_mean(),
    N=survey_total(),
    n=unweighted(n()), .groups="drop"
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 6
##   VotedPres2016     p    p_se          N     N_se     n

## 2 No            0.148 0.00768  29632875. 1669962.   444
```
???
- to get proportions we use `group_by` and `survey_mean`
- also use `survey_total` to get a population count estimate as before
---
## Conditional proportions with more than one group

- Specifying more than one group calculates conditional proportions
- Example: people voting in 2012 and 2016


```r
anes_des %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(VotedPres2012), !is.na(VotedPres2016)) %&gt;%
  group_by(VotedPres2012, VotedPres2016) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    p=survey_mean(),
    N=survey_total(),
    n=unweighted(n()), .groups="drop"
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 7
##   VotedPres2012 VotedPres2016      p    p_se          N     N_se     n
##   &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Yes           Yes           0.905  0.00717 137951845. 3318434.  2441
## 2 Yes           No            0.0948 0.00717  14455048. 1165836.   225
## 3 No            Yes           0.679  0.0199   31671027. 1780765.   435
## 4 No            No            0.321  0.0199   14980427. 1165804.   215
```
???
- Note that this is the proportion of voting in 2016 by whether people voted in 2012
- What if we don't want conditional proportions?

---
## Joint proportions with more than one group

- Specify an interaction to get joint distribution
- Example: people voting in 2012 and 2016


```r
anes_des %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(VotedPres2012), !is.na(VotedPres2016)) %&gt;%
* group_by(groups = interaction(VotedPres2016, VotedPres2012)) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    p=survey_mean(),
    N=survey_total(),
    .groups="drop"
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 5
##   groups       p    p_se          N     N_se
##   &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Yes.Yes 0.693  0.00971 137951845. 3318434.
## 2 No.Yes  0.0726 0.00569  14455048. 1165836.
## 3 Yes.No  0.159  0.00812  31671027. 1780765.
## 4 No.No   0.0753 0.00559  14980427. 1165804.
```
???
- We add an interaction for the groups
- This outputs the joint distribution, but the `groups` variable is hard to interpret

---
## Joint proportions with more than one group

- Specify an interaction to get joint distribution

*   VotedPres2016=VotedPres2016[1],
    p=survey_mean(),
    N=survey_total(),
    .groups="drop"
  )
```

```
???
- We can add in two variables one for `VotedPres2012` and `VotedPres2016`
- using the 1 in brackets pulls out the labels for these two variables so we see the "Yes" and "No" labels

svychisq(formula,
         design, 
         statistic = c("F",  "Chisq", "Wald", "adjWald", "lincom", "saddlepoint"),
         na.rm=TRUE,
         ...)
```
???
- when we want to test categorical distributions we use `svychisq`
- it takes a formula, and the survey design data

---
## `svychisq` Example 1: Function Defaults

- How often can you trust the federal gov't to do what is right?
- How often can you trust other people?


```r
anes_des %&gt;%
   svychisq(design=.,
            formula=~TrustPeople +TrustGovernment)
```

```
## 
## 	Pearson's X^2: Rao &amp; Scott adjustment
## 
## data:  NextMethod()
## F = 12.608, ndf = 13.161, ddf = 1750.368, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
```
???
- We want to compare the distributions of these two questions

---
## `svychisq` Example 2: Wald Statistic

- How often can you trust the federal gov't to do what is right?
- Who did you vote for? Clinton, Trump, or Other


```r
anes_des %&gt;%
   svychisq(design=.,
            formula=~TrustGovernment +VotedPres2016_selection,
            statistic="Wald")
```

```
## 
## 	Design-based Wald test of association
## 
## data:  NextMethod()
## F = 24.692, ndf = 8, ddf = 133, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
```
???
- Can use different statistics

## Practice on your own

- Open CategoricalExercises.Rmd and work through the exercises

- We will take 10 minutes. Use this time for the exercises and a break

# Sample design object
---
## `tbl_svy` Object: Taylor's Series

- `tbl_svy` object defines the sampling design or replicate weights

- Key information is usually found in documentation of a public use file


```r
as_survey_design(
  .data,
  ids = NULL,#cluster IDs/PSUs
  strata = NULL,#strata variables
  variables = NULL,#defaults to all in .data
  fpc = NULL,#variables defining the fpc
  nest = FALSE,#TRUE/FALSE - relabel clusters to nest within strata
  check_strata = !nest, #check that clusters are nested in strata
  weights = NULL,# weight variable
  ...
)
```

???
- discussing TSL first
---
## `tbl_svy` for Common Designs


```r
# simple random sample (SRS)
apisrs %&gt;% as_survey_design(fpc = fpc)

# stratified sample
apistrat %&gt;% as_survey_design(strata = stype, weights = pw)

# one-stage cluster sample
apiclus1 %&gt;% as_survey_design(ids = dnum, weights = pw, fpc = fpc)

# two-stage cluster sample, weights computed from pop size
apiclus2 %&gt;% as_survey_design(ids = c(dnum, snum), fpc = c(fpc1, fpc2))

# stratified, cluster design
apistrat %&gt;% as_survey_design(ids = dnum, strata = stype, weights =pw, nest = TRUE)
```
